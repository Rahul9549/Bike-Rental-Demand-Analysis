# Bike Rental Analysis Project
### This repository contains the code and documentation for a bike rental analysis project aimed at predicting bike rental demand. The project covers various stages from basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to deploying a machine learning model for forecasting rental demand usinf Flask.

## Overview
### The bike rental analysis project focuses on developing a predictive model to forecast bike rental demand based on historical data. The main objectives of the project include:
#### 1. Exploring and understanding the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
#### 2. Preprocessing the data to prepare it for model training.
#### 3. Selecting and training machine learning models to predict bike rental demand.
#### 4. Evaluating model performance and selecting the best-performing model.
#### 5. Deploying the selected model to provide rental demand forecasts.

## Project Workflow

## 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
#### A. Explore the dataset to understand its structure, features, and distributions.
#### B. Handle missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
#### C. Perform feature engineering to extract relevant information.

## 2. Model Development:

#### A. Split the data into training and testing sets.
#### B. Train machine learning models using various algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
#### C. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).

## 3. Model Deployment:

#### A. Deploy the selected model using Flask to create a web application.
#### B. Provide an intuitive interface for users to input parameters and obtain bike rental demand forecasts.
